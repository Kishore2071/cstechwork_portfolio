			Started programming at the age of 15, I got a keen interest towards Cyber Security and have explored
			multiple dimensions of it. I took the road of Entrepreneurship and progressively
			worked with multiple companies and startups on multiple technologies ranging from software to
			security to hardware, which gave me a brief exposure towards the industry. You can contact me for a
